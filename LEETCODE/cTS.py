itâ€™s like a list of dictionaries of basketball games
each game has a home team, away team, and winning team
from that you gotta make a new dictionary of dictionaries 
where each key is a team and then the value is how many win, loss and ties they have

then it extends to sort the teams in order of points
a win is 3 points, a tie is 1 point and a loss is 0 points
